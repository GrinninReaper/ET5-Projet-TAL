A form of asbestos used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to more than 30 years , researchers reported . 
The asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is resilient once enters the lungs , with brief exposures to causing symptoms that show up decades later , researchers said . 
Lorillard Inc. , the unit of New York - based Loews Corp. that makes Kent cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in Micronite cigarette filters in 1956 . 
Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year , the latest results appear in today's New England Journal of Medicine , a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem . 
A Lorillard spokewoman said , `` is an old story . 
're talking about years before heard of asbestos having any questionable properties . 
is no asbestos in products . 
" Neither Lorillard nor the researchers studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes . 
`` have on no useful information whether users are at risk , " said James A. Talcott of Boston's Dana Farber Cancer Institute . 
Dr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University . 
The Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in `` modest amounts " in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956 . 
From 1953 to 1955 , 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold , the company said . 
Among 33 men worked with the substance , 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number . 
Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos related diseases , including three with diagnosed cancer . 
The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was higher than expected , the researchers said . 
`` The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of study asbestos related diseases , " said Dr. Talcott . 
The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton , Mass . 
, paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries , said . 
The plant , is owned by Hollingsworth & Vose Co. , was under contract with Lorillard to make the cigarette filters . 
The finding will support those argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found in most schools and other buildings , Dr. Talcott said . 
The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles , according to Brooke T. Mossman , a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine . 
common chrysotile fibers are curly and are rejected by the body , Dr. Mossman explained . 
In July , the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on all uses of asbestos . 
By 1997 , all remaining uses of cancer causing asbestos will be outlawed . 
About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s . 
Areas of the factory were dusty the crocidolite was used . 
Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters . 
Workers described `` clouds of blue dust " that hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans ventilated the area . 
`` is no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos related diseases , " said Darrell Phillips , vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose . 
`` But have to recognize that these events took place 35 years . 
has no bearing on work force today . 
Yields on money market mutual funds continued to slide , amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates . 
The average seven-day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC's Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45 % from 8.47 % for the week ended Tuesday . 
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year . 
Average maturity of the funds' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days , the longest since early August , according to Donoghue's . 
Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because permit portfolio managers to retain higher rates for a longer period . 
Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates . 
The average maturity for funds open to institutions , considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market , reached a high point for the year -- 33 days . 
, said Brenda Malizia Negus , editor of Money Fund Report , yields `` may blip up before blip down " because of recent rises in short-term interest rates . 
The yield on six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction , , rose to 8.04 % from 7.90 % . 
Despite recent declines in yields , investors continue to pour cash into money funds . 
Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $ 1.5 billion during the latest week , to $ 352.7 billion . 
, money fund yields beat comparable short-term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates . 
The top money funds are yielding over 9 % .

The federal government suspended sales of U.S. savings bonds because Congress has n't lifted the ceiling on government debt . 
Until Congress acts , the government has n't any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind , the Treasury said . 
The government's borrowing authority dropped at midnight Tuesday to $ 2.80 trillion from $ 2.87 trillion . 
Legislation to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled in the fight over cutting capital gains taxes . 
The House has voted to raise the ceiling to $ 3.1 trillion , but the Senate is n't expected to act until next week at the earliest . 
The Treasury said the U.S. will default on Nov. 9 if Congress does n't act .

The National Association of Manufacturers settled on the Hoosier capital of Indianapolis for fall board meeting . 
And the city decided to treat guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners . 
The idea , : to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the Rust Belt is n't rusty after all , that is a good place for a company to expand . 
On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag , along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory . 
For starters , the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist comedian Victor Borge . 
Champagne and dessert followed . 
The next morning , with a police escort , busloads of executives and wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway , unimpeded by traffic or red lights . 
The governor could n't make , so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests .

South Korea registered a trade deficit of $ 101 million in October , reflecting the country's economic sluggishness , according to government figures released Wednesday . 
Preliminary tallies by the Trade and Industry Ministry showed another trade deficit in October , the fifth monthly setback this year , casting a cloud on South Korea's export oriented economy . 
Exports in October stood at $ 5.29 billion , a mere 0.7 % increase from a year earlier , while imports increased to $ 5.39 billion , 20 % from last October . 
South Korea's economic boom , began in 1986 , stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes , trade conflicts and sluggish exports . 
Government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ 68 billion . 
Despite the gloomy forecast , South Korea has recorded a trade surplus of $ 71 million so far this year . 
From January to October , the nation's accumulated exports increased 4 % from the same period last year to $ 50.45 billion . 
Imports were at $ 50.38 billion , 19 % . 
Newsweek , trying to keep pace with rival Time magazine , announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers . 
The new ad plan from Newsweek , a unit of the Washington Post Co. , is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years . 
Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek , Time Warner Inc.'s Time Magazine , and Mortimer B. Zuckerman's U.S. News & World Report . 
Alan Spoon , named Newsweek president , said Newsweek's ad rates would increase 5 % in January . 
A full , four color page in Newsweek will cost $ 100,980 . 
In mid-October , Time magazine lowered guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates ; with a lower circulation base , Time's ad rate will be 7.5 % higher per subscriber ; a full page in Time costs $ 120,000 . 
U.S. News has to announce 1990 ad rates . 
Newsweek said will introduce the Circulation Credit Plan , awards space credits to advertisers on `` renewal advertising . 
" The magazine will reward with `` page bonuses " advertisers in 1990 meet or exceed 1989 spending , as long as spent $ 325,000 in 1989 and $ 340,000 in 1990 . 
Mr. Spoon said the plan is not an attempt to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989 ; Newsweek's ad pages totaled 1,620 , a drop of 3.2 % from last year , according to Publishers Information Bureau . 
`` matters is advertisers are paying per page , and in that department are doing this fall , " said Mr. Spoon . 
Both Newsweek and U.S. News have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers , such as telephones or watches . 
, none of the big three weeklies recorded circulation gains . 
According to Audit Bureau of Circulations , Time , the largest , had average circulation of 4,393,237 , a decrease of 7.3 % . 
Newsweek's circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453 , flat from the same period last year . 
U.S. News' circulation in the same time was 2,303,328 , 2.6 % . 
New England Electric System bowed out of the bidding for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , saying that the risks were high and the potential payoff in the future to justify a higher offer . 
The move leaves United Illuminating Co. and Northeast Utilities as the remaining outside bidders for PS of New Hampshire , has proposed an internal reorganization plan in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under which would remain an independent company . 
New England Electric , based in Westborough , Mass . 
, had offered $ 2 billion to acquire PS of New Hampshire , below the $ 2.29 billion value United Illuminating places on bid and the $ 2.25 billion Northeast says bid is worth . 
United Illuminating is based in New Haven , Conn . 
, and Northeast is based in Hartford , Conn . 
PS of New Hampshire , Manchester , N.H. , values internal reorganization plan at $ 2.2 billion . 
John Rowe , president and chief executive officer of New England Electric , said the company's return on equity could suffer if made a higher bid and forecasts related to PS of New Hampshire -- such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies -- did n't come true . 
`` evaluated raising bid , the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years , and the rewards seemed a long way out . 
got to take , " added . 
Mr. Rowe noted that political concerns worried New England Electric . 
No matter owns PS of New Hampshire , after emerges from bankruptcy proceedings rates will be among the highest in the nation , said . 
`` attracts attention . 
. 
. 
was another one of the risk factors " that led to the company's decision to withdraw from the bidding , added . 
Wilbur Ross Jr. of Rothschild Inc. , the financial adviser to the troubled company's equity holders , said the withdrawal of New England Electric might speed up the reorganization process . 
The fact that New England proposed lower rate increases -- 4.8 % over seven years against around 5.5 % boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders -- complicated negotiations with state officials , Mr. Ross asserted . 
`` the field is cluttered , " added . 
, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission turned down for a request by Northeast seeking approval of possible purchase of PS of New Hampshire . 
Northeast said would refile request and hopes for an expedited review by the FERC so that could complete the purchase by next summer if bid is the one approved by the bankruptcy court . 
PS of New Hampshire shares closed yesterday at $ 3.75 , off 25 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . 
Norman Ricken , 52 years old and former president and chief operating officer of Toys ``R" Us Inc. , and Frederick Deane Jr. , 63 , chairman of Signet Banking Corp. , were elected directors of this consumer electronics and appliances retailing chain .

Commonwealth Edison Co. was ordered to refund $ 250 million to current and former ratepayers for illegal rates collected for cost overruns on a nuclear power plant . 
The refund was $ 55 million more than ordered by the Illinois Commerce Commission and trade groups said may be the largest required of a state or local utility . 
State court Judge Richard Curry ordered Edison to make average refunds of $ 45 to $ 50 each to Edison customers have received electric service since April 1986 , including two million customers have moved during that period . 
Judge Curry ordered the refunds to begin Feb. 1 and said that would n't entertain any appeals or other attempts to block order by Commonwealth Edison . 
`` The refund pool . 
. 
. 
may not be held hostage through another round of appeals , " Judge Curry said . 
Commonwealth Edison said is appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing Judge Curry's order . 
The exact amount of the refund will be determined next year based on actual collections made until Dec. 31 of this year . 
Commonwealth Edison said the ruling could force to slash 1989 earnings by $ 1.55 a share . 
For 1988 , Commonwealth Edison reported earnings of $ 737.5 million , or $ 3.01 a share . 
A Commonwealth Edison spokesman said that tracking down the two million customers addresses have changed during the past 3 1/2 years would be `` an administrative nightmare . 
" In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Commonwealth Edison closed at $ 38.375 , 12.5 cents . 
The $ 2.5 billion Byron 1 plant near Rockford , Ill. , was completed in 1985 . 
In a disputed 1985 ruling , the Commerce Commission said Commonwealth Edison could raise electricity rates by $ 49 million to pay for the plant . 
But state courts upheld a challenge by consumer groups to the commission's rate increase and found the rates illegal . 
The Illinois Supreme Court ordered the commission to audit Commonwealth Edison's construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses . 
The utility has been collecting for the plant's construction cost from 3.1 million customers subject to a refund since 1986 . 
In August , the commission ruled that between $ 190 million and $ 195 million of the plant's construction cost was unreasonable and should be refunded , plus interest . 
In ruling , Judge Curry added an additional $ 55 million to the commission's calculations . 
Last month , Judge Curry set the interest rate on the refund at 9 % . 
Commonwealth Edison faces an additional court ordered refund on summer \ / winter rate differential collections that the Illinois Appellate Court has estimated at $ 140 million . 
And consumer groups hope that Judge Curry's Byron 1 order may set a precedent for a second nuclear rate case involving Commonwealth Edison's Braidwood 2 plant . 
Commonwealth Edison is seeking $ 245 million in rate increases to pay for Braidwood 2 . 
The commission is expected to rule on the Braidwood 2 case by year end . 
Last year Commonwealth Edison had to refund $ 72.7 million for poor performance of LaSalle I nuclear plant . 
Japan's domestic sales of cars , trucks and buses in October rose 18 % from a year earlier to 500,004 units , a record for the month , the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said . 
The strong growth followed year to year increases of 21 % in August and 12 % in September .

Sales of passenger cars grew 22 % from a year earlier to 361,376 units . 
Sales of medium sized cars , benefited from price reductions arising from introduction of the consumption tax , than doubled to 30,841 units from 13,056 in October 1988 . 
Texas Instruments Japan Ltd . 
, a unit of Texas Instruments Inc. , said opened a plant in South Korea to manufacture control devices . 
The new plant , located in Chinchon 60 miles from Seoul , will help meet increasing and diversifying demand for control products in South Korea , the company said . 
The plant will produce control devices used in motor vehicles and household appliances . 
The survival of spinoff Cray Computer Corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend on the creativity -- and longevity -- of chairman and chief designer , Seymour Cray . 
is development of the new company's initial machine tied to Mr. Cray , is balance sheet . 
Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that Cray Research Inc. will withdraw the $ 100 million in financing is providing the new firm if Mr. Cray leaves or if the product design project heads is scrapped . 
The documents said that although the 64 year old Mr. Cray has been working on the project for more than six years , the Cray - 3 machine is another year away from a operational prototype . 
Moreover , have been no orders for the Cray - 3 , though the company says is talking with several prospects . 
While many of the risks were anticipated Minneapolis - based Cray Research announced the spinoff in May , the strings attached to the financing had n't been made public until yesterday . 
`` did n't have of a choice , " Cray Computer's chief financial officer , Gregory Barnum , said in an interview . 
`` The theory is that Seymour is the chief designer of the Cray - 3 , and without could not be completed . 
Cray Research did not want to fund a project that did not include Seymour . 
" The documents said that Cray Computer anticipates needing another $ 120 million in financing beginning next September . 
But Mr. Barnum called `` a worst case " scenario . 
The filing on the details of the spinoff caused Cray Research stock to jump $ 2.875 yesterday to close at $ 38 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . 
Analysts noted yesterday that Cray Research's decision to link $ 98.3 million promissory note to Mr. Cray's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company . 
`` has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor , " said Gary P. Smaby of Smaby Group Inc. , Minneapolis . 
`` Cray Computer will be a concept stock , " said . 
`` believe Seymour can do or do n't . 
" Besides the designer's age , other risk factors for Mr. Cray's new company include the Cray - 3's tricky , unproven chip technology . 
The SEC documents describe those chips , are made of gallium arsenide , as being fragile and minute will require special robotic handling equipment . 
, the Cray - 3 will contain 16 processors -- the largest current supercomputer . 
Cray Computer will face intense competition , not from Cray Research , has 60 % of the world-wide supercomputer market and is expected to roll out the - 90 machine , a direct competitor with the Cray - 3 , in 1991 . 
The spinoff will compete with International Business Machines Corp. and Japan's Big Three -- Hitachi Ltd. , NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. The new company said believes are fewer than 100 potential customers for supercomputers priced between $ 15 million and $ 30 million -- the Cray - 3 price range . 
Under terms of the spinoff , Cray Research stockholders are to receive one Cray Computer share for every two Cray Research shares own in a distribution expected to occur in two weeks . 
No price for the new shares has been set . 
, the companies will leave the marketplace to decide . 
Cray Computer has applied to trade on Nasdaq . 
Analysts calculate Cray Computer's initial book value at $ 4.75 a share . 
Along with the note , Cray Research is transferring $ 53 million in assets , those related to the Cray - 3 development , has been a drain on Cray Research's earnings . 
Pro-forma balance sheets show Cray Research favored the spinoff . 
Without the Cray - 3 research and development expenses , the company would have been able to report a profit of $ 19.3 million for the first half of 1989 rather than the $ 5.9 million posted . 
On the other hand , had existed , Cray Computer would have incurred a $ 20.5 million loss . 
Mr. Cray , could n't be reached for comment , will work for the new Colorado Springs , Colo . 
, company as an independent contractor -- the arrangement had with Cray Research . 
Regarded as the father of the supercomputer , Mr. Cray was paid $ 600,000 at Cray Research last year . 
At Cray Computer , will be paid $ 240,000 . 
Besides Messrs . 
Cray and Barnum , other senior management at the company includes Neil Davenport , 47 , president and chief executive officer ; Joseph M. Blanchard , 37 , vice president , engineering ; Malcolm A. Hammerton , 40 , vice president , software ; and Douglas R. Wheeland , 45 , vice president , hardware .

The U.S. , claiming some success in trade diplomacy , removed South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia from a list of countries is watching for failing to honor U.S. patents , copyrights and other intellectual property rights . 
, five other countries -- China , Thailand , India , Brazil and Mexico -- will remain on that so-called priority watch list as a result of an interim review , U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced . 
Under the new U.S. trade law , those countries could face accelerated unfair trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if do n't improve protection of intellectual property by next spring . 
Mrs. Hills said many of the 25 countries that placed under varying degrees of scrutiny have made `` genuine progress " on this touchy issue . 
said is `` growing realization " around the world that denial of intellectual property rights harms all trading nations , and the `` creativity and inventiveness of an offending country's own citizens . 
" U.S. trade negotiators argue that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual property rights could be hurting by discouraging own scientists and authors and by deterring U.S. high technology firms from investing or marketing best products . 
Mrs. Hills lauded South Korea for creating an intellectual property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained to pursue movie and book pirates . 
Seoul has instituted effective search and seizure procedures to aid these teams , said . 
Taiwan has improved standing with the U.S. by initialing a bilateral copyright agreement , amending trademark law and introducing legislation to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of films . 
That measure could compel Taipei's growing number of small video viewing parlors to pay movie producers for showing films . 
Saudi Arabia , for part , has vowed to enact a copyright law compatible with international standards and to apply the law to computer software as to literary works , Mrs. Hills said . 
These three countries are n't off the hook , . 
will remain on a lower priority list that includes 17 other countries . 
Those countries -- including Japan , Italy , Canada , Greece and Spain -- are of some concern to the U.S. but are deemed to pose serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the `` priority " list . 
Gary Hoffman , a Washington lawyer specializing in intellectual property cases , said the threat of U.S. retaliation , combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country's own interest , prompted the improvements made by South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia . 
`` tells is that U.S. trade law is working , " said . 
said Mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of efforts to craft a new patent law . 
Mrs. Hills said that the U.S. is concerned about `` disturbing developments in Turkey and continuing slow progress in Malaysia . 
" did n't elaborate , although earlier U.S. trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey . 
The 1988 trade act requires Mrs. Hills to issue another review of the performance of these countries by April 30 . 
So , Mrs. Hills has n't deemed any cases bad to merit an accelerated investigation under the so-called special 301 provision of the act . 
Argentina said will ask creditor banks to halve foreign debt of $ 64 billion -- the third highest in the developing world . 
The declaration by Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli is believed to be the first time such an action has been called for by an Argentine official of such stature . 
The Latin American nation has paid on debt since early last year . 
`` Argentina aspires to reach a reduction of 50 % in the value of external debt , " Mr. Rapanelli said through spokesman , Miguel Alurralde . 
Mr. Rapanelli met in August with U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford . 
Argentine negotiator Carlos Carballo was in Washington and New York this week to meet with banks . 
Mr. Rapanelli has said the government of President Carlos Menem , took office Jul. 8 , feels a significant reduction of principal and interest is the only way the debt problem may be solved . 
But has not said before that the country wants half the debt forgiven . 
During centennial year , The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history . 
THREE COMPUTERS that CHANGED the face of personal computing were launched in 1977 . 
That year the Apple II , Commodore Pet and Tandy TRS-80 came to market . 
The computers were crude by today's standards . 
Apple II owners , , had to use television sets as screens and stored data on audiocassettes . 
But Apple II was a major advance from Apple I , was built in a garage by Stephen Wozniak and Steven Jobs for hobbyists such as the Homebrew Computer Club . 
, the Apple II was an affordable $ 1,298 . 
Crude as were , these early PCs triggered explosive product development in desktop models for the home and office . 
Big mainframe computers for business had been around for years . 
But the new 1977 PCs -- unlike earlier built from kit types such as the Altair , Sol and IMSAI -- had keyboards and could store two pages of data in memories . 
Current PCs are more than 50 times faster and have memory capacity 500 times greater than 1977 counterparts . 
were many pioneer PC contributors . 
William Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 developed an early language housekeeper system for PCs , and Gates became an industry billionaire six years after IBM adapted one of these versions in 1981 . 
Alan F. Shugart , chairman of Seagate Technology , led the team that developed the disk drives for PCs . 
Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington , two Atlanta engineers , were co developers of the internal modems that allow PCs to share data via the telephone . 
IBM , the world leader in computers , did n't offer first PC until August 1981 as many other companies entered the market . 
Today , PC shipments total some $ 38.3 billion world-wide . 
F.H. Faulding & Co . 
, an Australian pharmaceuticals company , said Moleculon Inc. affiliate acquired Kalipharma Inc. for $ 23 million . 
Kalipharma is a New Jersey - based pharmaceuticals concern that sells products under the Purepac label . 
Faulding said owns 33 % of Moleculon's voting stock and has an agreement to acquire an additional 19 % . 
That stake , with convertible preferred stock holdings , gives Faulding the right to increase interest to 70 % of Moleculon's voting stock . 
Oil production from Australia's Bass Strait fields will be raised by 11,000 barrels a day to 321,000 barrels with the launch of the Whiting field , the first of five small fields scheduled to be brought into production before the end of 1990 . 
Esso Australia Ltd . 
, a unit of New York - based Exxon Corp. , and Broken Hill Pty. operate the fields in a joint venture . 
Esso said the Whiting field started production Tuesday . 
Output will be increased until reaches 11,000 barrels a day . 
The field has reserves of 21 million barrels . 
Reserves for the five new fields total 50 million barrels .

The White House said President Bush has approved duty free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that are n't produced in `` significant quantities " in the U.S. , the Virgin Islands and other U.S. possessions . 
The action came in response to a petition filed by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations . 
, watch imports were denied such duty free treatment . 
Timex had requested duty free treatment for many types of watches , covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications . 
The White House said Mr. Bush decided to grant duty free status for 18 categories , but turned down such treatment for other types of watches `` because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands . 
" Timex is a major U.S. producer and seller of watches , including low priced battery operated watches assembled in the Philippines and other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences . 
U.S. trade officials said the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president's action . 
Imports of the types of watches that will be eligible for duty free treatment totaled $ 37.3 million in 1988 , a small share of the $ 1.5 billion in U.S. watch imports that year , according to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills . 
Magna International Inc.'s chief financial officer , James McAlpine , resigned and chairman , Frank Stronach , is stepping in to help turn around the automotive parts manufacturer , the company said . 
Mr. Stronach will direct an effort to reduce overhead and curb capital spending `` until a satisfactory level of profit is achieved and maintained , " Magna said .

Japanese investors single handedly bought up two new mortgage securities based mutual funds totaling $ 701 million , the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association said . 
The purchases show the strong interest of Japanese investors in U.S. mortgage based instruments , Fannie Mae's chairman , David O. Maxwell , said at a news conference . 
said more than 90 % of the funds were placed with Japanese institutional investors . 
The rest went to investors from France and Hong Kong . 
Earlier this year , Japanese investors snapped up a similar , $ 570 million mortgage-backed securities mutual fund . 
That fund was put together by Blackstone Group , a New York investment bank . 
The latest two funds were assembled by Goldman , Sachs & Co. of the U.S. and Japan's Daiwa Securities Co . 
The new , seven-year funds -- one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating rate return linked to the London interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to Japanese investors . 
First , are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment -- mortgage-backed securities can be retired if interest rates decline , and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy money at lower rates . 
Second , channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments , reducing the administrative burden on investors . 
By addressing those problems , Mr. Maxwell said , the new funds have become `` attractive to Japanese and other investors outside the U.S. . 
" Such devices have boosted Japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than 1 % of the $ 900 billion in such instruments outstanding , and purchases are growing at a rapid rate . 
have become large purchasers of Fannie Mae's corporate debt , buying $ 2.4 billion in Fannie Mae bonds during the first nine months of the year , or a tenth of the total amount issued . 
James L. Pate , 54 year old executive vice president , was named a director of this oil concern , expanding the board to 14 members .

The offer is being launched pursuant to a announced agreement between the companies . 
Japan's reserves of gold , convertible foreign currencies , and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $ 1.82 billion in October to $ 84.29 billion , the Finance Ministry said . 
The total marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline . 
The protracted downturn reflects the intensity of Bank of Japan yen support intervention since June , the U.S. currency surged above the 150.00 yen level . 
The announcement follows a sharper $ 2.2 billion decline in the country's foreign reserves in September to $ 86.12 billion . 
Pick a country , any country . 
is the latest investment craze sweeping Wall Street : a rash of new closed end country funds , those traded portfolios that invest in stocks of a single foreign country . 
fewer than 24 country funds have been launched or registered with regulators this year , the level of all of 1988 , according to Charles E. Simon & Co . 
, a Washington - based research firm . 
The turf has ranged from Chile to Austria to Portugal . 
Next week , the Philippine Fund's launch will be capped by a visit by Philippine President Corazon Aquino -- the first time a head of state has kicked off an issue at the Big Board . 
The next province ? 
`` Anything is possible -- the New Guinea Fund ? 
" quips George Foot , a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates of Northampton , Mass. The recent explosion of country funds mirrors the `` closed end fund mania " of the 1920s , Mr. Foot says , focused funds grew popular . 
fell into oblivion after the 1929 crash . 
Unlike traditional open end mutual funds , of these one country portfolios are the `` closed end " type , issuing a fixed number of shares that trade . 
The surge brings to 50 the number of country funds that are or will be listed in New York or London . 
These funds account for several billions of dollars in assets . 
`` People are looking to stake claims " the number of available nations runs out , says Michael Porter , an analyst at Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co . 
, New York . 
Behind all the hoopla is some heavy duty competition . 
As individual investors have turned from the stock market over the years , securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell . 
And the firms are stretching nets and to do . 
Financial planners urge investors to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities . 
And many emerging markets have outpaced mature markets , such as the U.S. and Japan . 
Country funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies . 
But does n't take much to get burned . 
Political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds . 
Another concern : The funds' share prices tend to swing than the broader market . 
the stock market dropped 7 % Oct. 13 , , the Mexico Fund plunged 18 % and the Spain Fund fell 16 % . 
And most country funds were clobbered than most stocks after the 1987 crash . 
is wild about the funds' frenzy is that many are trading at fat premiums to the value of underlying portfolios . 
After trading at an average discount of more than 20 % in late 1987 and part of last year , country funds trade at an average premium of 6 % . 
The reason : Share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed than the foreign stocks hold . 
is worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are closed to foreign investors , such as South Korea , some specialists say . 
But some European funds have skyrocketed ; Spain Fund has surged to a startling 120 % premium . 
has been targeted by Japanese investors as a good long-term play tied to 1992's European economic integration . 
And several new funds that are n't invested have jumped to trade at big premiums . 
`` 'm alarmed to see these rich valuations , " says Smith Barney's Mr. Porter . 
The fattened premiums reflect the global marketing of some country funds , Mr. Porter suggests . 
Unlike many U.S. investors , those in Asia or Europe seeking foreign stock exposure may be resistant to paying higher prices for country funds . 
`` may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed , " Mr. Porter says . 
, plenty of U.S. analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds . 
argue that U.S. investors can buy American depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds ; these so-called ADRs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the U.S. . 
That way investors can buy the funds without paying the premium . 
For people insist on jumping in to buy the funds , Newgate's Mr. Foot says : `` The only advice have for these folks is that those come to the party had be ready to leave . 
The U.S. and Soviet Union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by Moscow of $ 188 million in pre Communist Russian debts owed to the U.S. government , the State Department said . 
If the debts are repaid , could clear the way for Soviet bonds to be sold in the U.S. . 
, after two meetings with the Soviets , a State Department spokesman said that is `` to say " whether will happen . 
Coincident with the talks , the State Department said has permitted a Soviet bank to open a New York branch . 
The branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs was approved last spring and opened in July . 
But a Soviet bank would be crippled unless Moscow found a way to settle the $ 188 million debt , was lent to the country's short-lived democratic Kerensky government before the Communists seized power in 1917 . 
Under a 1934 law , the Johnson Debt Default Act , amended , is illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the U.S. government , unless are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund . 
The U.S.S.R. belongs to neither organization . 
Moscow has settled pre - 1917 debts with other countries in recent years at face value . 
The State Department stressed the pre - 1933 debts as the key to satisfying the Johnson Act . 
But the Soviets might face legal obstacles to raising money in the U.S. until settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt outstanding from the World War II lend lease program . 
In another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off , the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in September . 
, the National Association of Purchasing Management said latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in October for the sixth consecutive month . 
index inched 47.6 % in October from 46 % in September . 
Any reading below 50 % suggests the manufacturing sector is declining . 
The purchasing managers , , said that orders turned in October after four months of decline . 
Factories booked $ 236.74 billion in orders in September , the same as the $ 236.79 billion in August , the Commerce Department said . 
If not for a 59.6 % surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors , factory orders would have fallen 2.1 % . 
In a separate report , the department said construction spending ran at an annual rate of $ 415.6 billion , not different from the $ 415.8 billion reported for August . 
Private construction spending was , but government building activity was . 
The figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns , but were n't adjusted for inflation . 
Kenneth Mayland , economist for Society Corp. , a Cleveland bank , said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off . 
At the same time , the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry . 
`` sector is stepping to pick up the slack ? 
" asked . 
`` draw a blank . 
" By most measures , the nation's industrial sector is growing -- if at all . 
Factory payrolls fell in September . 
did the Federal Reserve Board's industrial production index . 
Yet many economists are n't predicting that the economy is to slip into recession . 
cite a lack of `` imbalances " that provide early warning signals of a downturn . 
Inventories are watched for such clues , . 
Economists say a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession . 
But yesterday's factory orders report had good news on that front : said factory inventories fell 0.1 % in September , the first decline since February 1987 . 
`` conforms to the ` soft landing ' scenario , " said Elliott Platt , an economist at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp . 
`` do n't see any signs that inventories are excessive . 
" A soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession . 
The department said orders for nondurable goods -- those intended to last more than three years -- fell 0.3 % in September to $ 109.73 billion climbing 0.9 % the month . 
Orders for durable goods were 0.2 % to $ 127.03 billion after rising 3.9 % the month . 
The department estimated that durable goods orders fell 0.1 % in September . 
Factory shipments fell 1.6 % to $ 234.4 billion after rising 5.4 % in August . 
Shipments have been level since January , the Commerce Department noted . 
Manufacturers' backlogs of unfilled orders rose 0.5 % in September to $ 497.34 billion , helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector . 
Excluding these orders , backlogs declined 0.3 % . 
In construction spending report , the Commerce Department said residential construction , accounts for half of all construction spending , was off 0.9 % in September to an annual rate of $ 191.9 billion . 
David Berson , economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association , predicted the drop in interest rates will boost spending on single family homes , but not until early next year . 
Spending on private , nonresidential construction was off 2.6 % to an annual rate of $ 99.1 billion with no sector showing strength . 
Government construction spending rose 4.3 % to $ 88 billion . 
adjusting for inflation , the Commerce Department said construction spending did n't change in September . 
For the first nine months of the year , total construction spending ran 2 % above last year's level . 
The government's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued in the week by McGraw-Hill Inc.'s F.W. Dodge Group . 
Dodge reported an 8 % increase in construction contracts awarded in September . 
The goverment counts money as is spent ; Dodge counts contracts are awarded . 
The government includes money spent on residential renovation ; Dodge does n't . 
Although the purchasing managers' index continues to indicate a slowing economy , is n't signaling an imminent recession , said Robert Bretz , chairman of the association's survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc. , Stamford , Conn. said the index would have to be in the low 40 % range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession . 
The report offered new evidence that the nation's export growth , though continuing , may be slowing . 
19 % of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in October , from 27 % in September . 
And 8 % said export orders were last month , compared with 6 % the month . 
The purhasing managers' report added evidence that inflation is under control . 
For the fifth consecutive month , purchasing managers said prices for the goods purchased fell . 
The decline was steeper than in September . 
said that vendors were delivering goods in October than had for each of the five previous months . 
Economists consider a sign that inflationary pressures are abating . 
demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen , prices tend to rise . 
The purchasing managers' report is based on data provided by more than 250 purchasing executives . 
Each of the survey's indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening . 
For the first time , the October survey polled members on imports . 
found that of the 73 % import , 10 % said imported in October and 12 % said imported less than the previous month . 
While acknowledging one month's figures do n't prove a trend , Mr. Bretz said , `` does lead to suspect imports are going , or not increasing . 
" Items listed as being in short supply numbered a dozen , but included one newcomer : milk and milk powder . 
`` is an odd thing to put on the list , " Mr. Bretz noted . 
said that for the second month in a row , food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk . 
blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of high U.S. exports of dry milk , coupled with low import quotas .

Judging from the Americana in Haruki Murakami's `` A Wild Sheep Chase " Kodansha , 320 pages , $ 18.95 , baby boomers on both sides of the Pacific have a lot in common . 
Although set in Japan , the novel's texture is Western , American . 
Characters drink Salty Dogs , whistle `` Johnny B. Goode " and watch Bugs Bunny reruns . 
read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo . 
worry about careers , drink and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs . 
is Japan ? 
For an American reader , part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in recognizing that Japan is n't the buttoned society of contemporary American lore . 
is refreshing to read a Japanese author does n't belong to the self aggrandizing `` Japanese " school of writers perpetuate the notion of the unique Japanese , unfathomable by outsiders . 
If `` A Wild Sheep Chase " carries an implicit message for international relations , is that the Japanese are like than most of think . 
is not to say that the nutty plot of `` A Wild Sheep Chase " is rooted in reality . 
is imaginative and funny . 
A disaffected , drinking , - 30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on back at the behest of a sinister , erudite mobster with a Stanford degree . 
has in tow prescient girlfriend , sassy retorts mark as anything but a docile butterfly . 
Along the way , meets a solicitous Christian chauffeur offers the hero God's phone number ; and the Sheep Man , a sweet , roughhewn figure wears -- -- a sheepskin . 
The 40 year old Mr. Murakami is a publishing sensation in Japan . 
A recent novel , `` Norwegian Wood " every Japanese under 40 seems to be fluent in Beatles lyrics , has sold more than four million copies since Kodansha published in 1987 . 
But is one of several youthful writers -- Tokyo's brat pack -- are dominating the best seller charts in Japan . 
books are written in idiomatic , contemporary language and carry hefty dashes of Americana . 
In Robert Whiting's `` Gotta Have Wa " Macmillan , 339 pages , $ 17.95 , the Beatles give way to baseball , in the Nipponese version would be put to call a `` game . 
" As Mr. Whiting describes , Nipponese baseball is a `` mirror of Japan's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony . 
" `` Wa " is Japanese for `` team spirit " and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of . 
A player's commitment to practice and team image is important as batting average . 
Polls named Tokyo Giants star Tatsunori Hara , a `` humble , uncomplaining , obedient soul , " as the male symbol of Japan . 
But other than the fact that besuboru is played with a ball and a bat , is unrecognizable : Fans return foul balls to stadium ushers ; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter ; ties are permitted -- even welcomed -- since sidestep the shame of defeat ; players must abide by strict rules of conduct in personal lives -- players for the Tokyo Giants , , must wear ties on the road . 
`` Gotta Have Wa " is the amusing chronicle of American ballplayers , rationed to two per team , fare in Japan . 
Despite the enormous sums of money 're paid to stand up at a Japanese plate , a good number decide is not worth and run for home . 
`` Funny Business " Soho , 228 pages , $ 17.95 by Gary Katzenstein is anything . 
is the petulant complaint of an impudent American Sony hosted for a year while was on a Luce Fellowship in Tokyo -- to the regret of both parties . 
In amusing , supercilious , vicious passages , Mr. Katzenstein describes Sony invades the mundane aspects of workers' lives -- at the regimented office , employees are assigned lunch partners -- and at `` home " in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker . 
Some of observations about Japanese management style are on the mark .
